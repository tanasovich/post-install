# Post-Install

Collection of scripts and configs to build custom system environment.

The point is to automate configuration of my own system. I am tired
of manual installation and configuration of each application.

I am going to store here Bash scripts that automate all my work.
Solution would be RPM package that everybody can install and launch
at any Fedora-based system.
